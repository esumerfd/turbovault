# Changelog

All notable changes to TurboVault will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.3.1] - 2026-04-05

### Changed

- **BatchOperationSchema**: Removed `BatchOperationInput` wrapper and derived `JsonSchema` directly on `BatchOperation` in `turbovault-batch` to fix MCP schema.
- **batch_execute MCP tool**: Fixed schema generation by using the correctly typed input model (`Vec<BatchOperation>`).

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added

- **`TaskStatus` enum**: Parser now distinguishes `Pending`, `Done`, `InProgress`, and `Cancelled` task states, supporting Obsidian's `[/]` and `[-]` checkbox markers.
- **Path-suffix index**: O(1) resolution of folder-qualified wikilinks like `[[Folder/Note]]`, replacing O(N) full-graph scan.
- **SearchEngine caching**: Tantivy index is now built once per vault and cached, with automatic invalidation on writes. Eliminates full re-index per query.
- **CSV injection protection**: All CSV export functions use RFC 4180 quoting with formula-prefix escaping (`=`, `+`, `-`, `@`).
- **CI security audit**: Added `cargo audit` (rustsec) and MSRV verification (Rust 1.90.0) jobs to CI pipeline.
- **67 new tests**: Comprehensive coverage for graph algorithms, edit engine strategies, batch execution, VaultCache persistence, TaskStatus, csv_escape, and manager file lifecycle operations. Total: 716 tests.

### Fixed

- **Graph `connected_components` used SCC instead of weakly connected**: Replaced Tarjan's SCC with UnionFind-based weakly connected components. Previously, `A→B→C` produced 3 singleton components; now correctly produces 1.
- **`HeadingRef` and `BlockRef` links dropped from graph**: Links like `[[Note#Heading]]` and `[[Note#^blockid]]` are now included in graph edge construction, fixing missing backlinks and broken link detection.
- **Same-document anchors flagged as broken**: `[[#Heading]]` links are now correctly skipped instead of being added to unresolved links.
- **`related_notes` used DFS instead of BFS**: Changed from `Vec::pop()` to `VecDeque::pop_front()` for correct breadth-first traversal.
- **Health score saturation cascade**: Penalties are now computed independently and summed, preventing early floor at 0.
- **Isolated cluster detection**: Uses largest-component exclusion instead of hardcoded `len < 5` threshold.
- **Batch `DeleteNote`/`MoveNote` bypassed VaultManager**: Now routed through `VaultManager::delete_file`/`move_file` for proper audit trails, graph updates, and cache invalidation.
- **`fuzzy_find_whitespace` always returned `None`**: Implemented line-based whitespace-normalized matching (Strategy 2 in the edit cascade).
- **Levenshtein DoS vector**: Added 10M character-comparison budget cap to prevent CPU exhaustion.
- **Temp file leak in `batch_execute`**: Removed `.keep()` call and unused `temp_dir` field from `BatchExecutor`.
- **Temp file orphaned on rename failure**: `write_file` now cleans up the temp file if atomic rename fails.
- **Graph update errors silently swallowed**: All `let _ = graph.*` calls replaced with `log::warn!`.
- **Tag regex rejected digit-first tags**: `#2024` and `#1password` now correctly parsed by both engine and deprecated parsers.
- **Deprecated tag parser matched URL fragments**: Added word-boundary guard to prevent `https://example.com#section` from producing a tag.
- **Deprecated frontmatter regex failed without trailing newline**: Now accepts `(?:\n|$)` at closing `---`.
- **CRLF offset tracking**: Callout parser accounts for `\r\n` line endings.
- **Tantivy field lookups used `.unwrap()`**: Field handles stored as struct fields, eliminating runtime panics.
- **`partial_cmp().unwrap()` on f64 sorts**: Replaced with panic-free `total_cmp()`.
- **Thundering herd on first vault access**: Double-checked locking prevents redundant initialization.

### Changed

- **Weakly connected components algorithm**: `connected_components()` now uses `petgraph::unionfind::UnionFind` for O(V + E·α(V)) performance.
- **`max_hops` capped at 5**: `get_related_notes` tool enforces a maximum traversal depth.
- **`max_vaults` limit**: `MultiVaultManager::add_vault` enforces a 50-vault cap.
- **Docker image pinned**: Builder uses `rust:1.90-bookworm`, removed semantically meaningless `HEALTHCHECK`.
- **docker-compose**: Removed deprecated `version: '3.8'` key.
- **CI**: `--all-features` added to clippy and test steps; `actions/checkout@v4` pinned.
- **Unused dependencies removed**: `nom`, `lazy_static`, `env_logger`, `insta` removed from workspace.
- **Export crate**: Removed phantom `turbovault-vault` dependency.

### Removed

- **`BatchExecutor.temp_dir` field**: Was unused dead code.
- **Hardcoded version in justfile**: Now reads dynamically from `Cargo.toml`.

## [1.2.11] - 2026-03-26

### Added

- **Multi-version MCP protocol support**: TurboVault now accepts clients requesting either MCP `2025-06-18` or `2025-11-25` specification versions. The server negotiates the protocol version during the `initialize` handshake and filters responses through a version adapter that strips fields not present in the older spec (icons, execution, outputSchema, tasks capability). Powered by TurboMCP v3.0.10's `ProtocolConfig::multi_version()`.
- **MCP session lifecycle enforcement**: All line-based transports (STDIO, TCP, Unix) enforce the MCP initialization lifecycle — requests before a successful `initialize` are rejected, and duplicate `initialize` requests are rejected. WebSocket and HTTP transports also enforce per-connection/session version tracking.
- **Auto-create missing vault directories**: `VaultConfig::validate()` and the `add_vault` MCP tool now create missing vault directories with `create_dir_all` instead of returning an error, enabling seamless first-run setup.

### Changed

- **Upgraded TurboMCP to v3.0.10**: Full migration from TurboMCP v3.0.0 to v3.0.10, adopting the `ProtocolVersion` enum, version adapter layer, `route_request_versioned()` API, and builder pattern with `ProtocolConfig::multi_version()` for spec-compliant multi-version response filtering.
- **Server startup uses builder pattern**: Replaced `server.run_stdio()` with `server.builder().with_protocol(ProtocolConfig::multi_version()).serve()` across all transports, enabling runtime protocol configuration.
- **Removed phantom `turbomcp-server` dependency**: The direct `turbomcp-server` dep (which existed only to activate the STDIO feature via default feature resolution) was replaced with an explicit `features = ["stdio", "telemetry"]` on the `turbomcp` dependency, making intent clear and preventing accidental feature loss.

### Fixed

- **Tilde expansion in vault paths**: Vault paths from CLI `--vault` arguments and `VaultConfigBuilder::build()` now expand `~` and `$ENV_VARS` via `shellexpand` before validation. Previously, `--vault ~/work/vault` created a literal `~/work/vault` directory relative to the CWD instead of resolving to the home directory.

## [1.2.9] - 2026-03-22

### Added

- **14 new MCP tools** (44 → 58 total), covering 5 major capability areas:

#### Semantic Similarity Search
- **`semantic_search`**: Find notes by meaning using TF-IDF cosine similarity — discovers conceptual matches beyond exact keyword overlap, with explainable shared-term reporting
- **`find_similar_notes`**: Find notes most similar in content to a given note, useful for discovering link candidates and thematic clusters

#### Content Quality Evaluation
- **`evaluate_note_quality`**: Score individual notes across readability (Flesch-Kincaid), structure (heading hierarchy, frontmatter, tags), completeness (word count, link density), and staleness (modification recency) dimensions
- **`vault_quality_report`**: Vault-wide quality metrics with score distribution, dimension averages, lowest/highest quality notes, and actionable recommendations
- **`find_stale_notes`**: Find notes not updated within a configurable threshold, sorted by staleness

#### Operation Audit Trail & Rollback
- **`audit_log`**: Query operation history with filters by path, operation type (CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE/MOVE), and result limit
- **`rollback_preview`**: Dry-run preview of what a rollback would change, including unified diff
- **`rollback_note`**: Restore a note to its state before a specific operation, with the rollback itself recorded in the audit trail
- **`audit_stats`**: Operation counts by type, total snapshot storage, and time range of recorded operations

#### Duplicate Detection
- **`find_duplicates`**: Two-stage near-duplicate detection using SimHash fingerprinting for fast candidate filtering followed by TF-IDF cosine similarity verification
- **`compare_notes`**: Detailed pairwise comparison with similarity score, shared terms, diff summary, and actionable recommendation (merge/link/keep)

#### Note Diff Tools
- **`diff_notes`**: Line-level and word-level diff between two notes with unified diff output and similarity ratio
- **`diff_note_version`**: Compare current note content with a previous version from the audit trail

- **New `turbovault-audit` crate**: Append-only JSONL operation log, content-addressed snapshot storage (SHA-256 dedup), and rollback engine with atomic file restoration
- **Optimistic concurrency control**: `write_note`, `delete_note`, `move_note`, and `move_file` now accept optional `expected_hash` parameter — if the file was modified since the caller's last `read_note`, the write fails with `ConcurrencyError` instead of silently overwriting. Enables safe multi-agent concurrent vault access.
- **UUID-based temp files**: Concurrent writes to the same file no longer collide on the temp path

### Changed

- **`VaultManager::write_file`** signature now includes `expected_hash: Option<&str>` for optimistic concurrency control. Internal callers pass `None` for backward compatibility.
- **`VaultManager::delete_file`** and **`VaultManager::move_file`** now handle audit trail recording, link graph cleanup, and optimistic concurrency checking — `FileTools` delegates to these instead of performing raw I/O
- **`AuditLog` uses `tokio::sync::Mutex`** for write serialization, preventing interleaved JSONL entries from concurrent MCP tool calls
- **Similarity engine cache invalidation**: All 9 mutating MCP tools (`write_note`, `edit_note`, `delete_note`, `move_note`, `move_file`, `batch_execute`, `update_frontmatter`, `manage_tags`, `create_from_template`) invalidate the cached TF-IDF vectors so subsequent similarity queries reflect current vault state

### Fixed

- **Heading hierarchy validator** now correctly flags documents starting with H2+ (no H1) as invalid, instead of awarding the hierarchy bonus
- **Diff summary accuracy**: `lines_changed` count now reflects the true number of changed line pairs, not the display-capped count (truncation to 50 inline changes only affects the detail list)
- **Staleness penalty integer truncation**: `linked_notes_newer` is now clamped before casting to `u8`, preventing silent wrap-around for hub notes with 256+ newer linked notes
- **`find_duplicates` verification accuracy**: Precise TF-IDF verification now queries the full document set instead of `limit=1`, eliminating false negatives when the candidate pair isn't the single most-similar result

## [1.2.8] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- **`get_notes_info` tool**: Bulk note metadata retrieval — returns `exists`, `size_bytes`, `modified_at`, and `has_frontmatter` for a list of paths without reading full file content, enabling efficient batch filesystem inspection.
- **`write_file_with_mode` tool**: Append and prepend support for file writes. Accepts a `mode` parameter (`overwrite`, `append`, `prepend`) and correctly handles frontmatter boundaries when prepending to YAML-frontmatter files.
- **Cross-filesystem move support**: `move_file` now handles `CrossesDevices` errors by falling back to a copy-then-delete strategy, maintaining atomicity guarantees across filesystem boundaries.
- **`AnalysisConfig` for health analysis**: Configurable `hub_notes_limit` (default 10) replaces the previously hardcoded cap of 5 in `HealthAnalyzer::analyze()`.
- **`LinkGraph::unresolved_link_count()` helper**: Convenience method returning the total count of unresolved links across all source files.

### Changed

- **`write_file` delegates to `write_file_with_mode`**: Existing `write_file` calls are fully backward-compatible and default to `WriteMode::Overwrite`.
- **`resolve_path` is now `pub`**: `VaultManager::resolve_path` is now publicly visible so tool layers (`FileTools`, `DataTools`) can reuse the battle-tested `path_trav`-backed security check without duplicating logic.
- **`read_file` always reads from disk**: Removed the in-memory `VaultFile` cache path from `read_file` — the cache stores parsed content with frontmatter stripped, so bypassing it ensures callers always receive the complete raw file including frontmatter.
- **Updated installation instructions and usage documentation in README**: Clarified TurboVault as both a Rust SDK and an MCP server with two distinct usage modes.
- **Two-pass vault initialization**: `VaultManager::initialize()` now adds all files to the graph index first, then resolves links in a second pass. This eliminates scan-order-dependent resolution failures where files scanned later were not in the index when earlier files resolved links to them.
- **Case-insensitive link resolution**: `LinkGraph::resolve_link` now lowercases all index keys at insertion and lookup time, matching Obsidian's case-insensitive wikilink behaviour.
- **`file_index` and `alias_index` handle stem collisions**: Changed from single-value to multi-value maps (`HashMap<String, Vec<NodeIndex>>`), so files with the same lowercased stem on case-sensitive filesystems are all indexed rather than silently overwriting each other.
- **Health score uses saturating arithmetic**: `HealthReport::calculate_score` now uses `saturating_sub` to prevent `u8` underflow when penalty values are large.
- **Updated TurboMCP to v3.0.6** and all workspace dependencies to latest compatible versions.

### Fixed

- **Broken link detection was non-functional**: `get_broken_links`, `quick_health_check`, and `full_health_analysis` always reported zero broken links because `HealthAnalyzer::new()` (graph-only mode) was used but unresolved links never entered the graph. Unresolved links are now tracked in `LinkGraph.unresolved_links` and wired into `HealthAnalyzer::with_files()`. (PR #6 by @AntttMan)
- **Petgraph swap-remove index corruption**: `remove_file` now correctly updates `path_index`, `file_index`, and `alias_index` after `remove_node`, which uses swap-remove internally and moves the last node into the removed slot. Previously, all external index maps for the swapped node became stale, causing wrong edges, self-loops, or panics on subsequent operations.
- **Path-suffix fallback ignored `.md` extension**: The `resolve_link` path-suffix fallback (for `[[folder/Note]]`-style wikilinks) now strips `.md` from path components before comparison, so multi-segment wikilinks without extensions resolve correctly.
- **Duplicate alias accumulation on re-add**: `add_file` called repeatedly (e.g. on every `write_file`) no longer pushes duplicate entries to `alias_index`.
- **Path traversal protection unified**: `delete_file`, `move_file`, `copy_file`, and `get_notes_info` now all go through `VaultManager::resolve_path` (backed by the `path_trav` crate) instead of ad-hoc `starts_with` checks, closing potential bypass vectors.
- **Stale `#[allow(dead_code)]` annotations**: `is_cache_expired` and `is_file_modified_since` are kept for future use and annotated with `#[allow(dead_code)]` to silence compiler warnings.

## [1.2.7] - 2026-03-04

### Changed

- **Upgraded TurboMCP to v3.0.0**: Full migration to TurboMCP v3 with `TelemetryConfig`-based observability, `#[turbomcp::server]` macro, and `McpHandlerExt` transport abstraction
- **Standardized response serialization**: All tools now use `StandardResponse::to_json()` consistently instead of mixed serialization patterns
- **Removed stale workspace dependencies**: Dropped unused `opentelemetry`, `tracing-opentelemetry`, and `opentelemetry-otlp` workspace deps (v0.28) that were superseded by turbomcp-telemetry (v0.31)

### Added

- **Cross-platform prebuilt binaries**: Release workflow now builds binaries for 7 targets (Linux glibc/musl x86_64/ARM64, macOS x86_64/ARM64, Windows x86_64) with macOS code signing/notarization, SHA256 checksums, and GitHub Releases
- **CI workflow modernized**: Bumped to `actions/checkout@v5`, stable Rust toolchain, `CARGO_TERM_COLOR`

### Fixed

- **Stale cache on external file modifications**: `read_note` now validates cache entries against the file's modification time on disk, so externally modified files (git sync, direct writes, other processes) are always read fresh instead of serving stale/empty cached content (fixes #5)
- **Server version mismatch**: MCP server macro now correctly advertises the current crate version to clients (was hardcoded to 1.1.6)
- **Repository metadata on crates.io**: All 8 workspace crates now set `repository.workspace = true`, so every crate on crates.io links back to the GitHub repo (fixes #4)
- **Removed unused variable** in `explain_vault` tool

### Improved

- **`get_hub_notes` now accepts `top_n` parameter**: Previously hardcoded to 10, now configurable with `top_n: Option<usize>` (default 10)

## [1.2.6] - 2025-12-16

### Added

- **Line offset tracking for inline elements**: `Link` and `Image` variants in `InlineElement` now include optional `line_offset` field that tracks the relative line position within nested list items. This enables precise positioning of inline elements for consumers that need line-level granularity.
- **Comprehensive nested inline element collection**: New `collect_inline_elements()` function recursively traverses nested blocks (paragraphs, lists, blockquotes, details) to gather all inline elements and populate parent list items' inline field. This ensures links and images from all nesting levels are discoverable.
- **Enhanced list parsing for nested items**: Improved handling of nested list structures with proper line offset tracking, indentation preservation, and task checkbox support across all nesting depths.

### Changed

- **List item inline field now complete**: Parent list items' `inline` field now contains links and images from all nested children, enabling comprehensive inline element discovery without manual traversal.

## [1.2.5] - 2025-12-12

### Changed

- **Optimized frontmatter parsing**: Removed redundant regex-based frontmatter extraction in favor of pulldown-cmark's byte offset tracking, eliminating a duplicate parse pass
- **Deprecated `extract_frontmatter`**: Function marked deprecated in favor of `ParseEngine` with `frontmatter_end_offset` for better performance

## [1.2.4] - 2025-12-12

### Added

- **Plain text extraction**: New `to_plain_text()` API for extracting visible text from markdown content, stripping all syntax. Useful for:
  - Search indexing (index only searchable text)
  - Accurate match counts (fixes treemd search mismatch where `[Overview](#overview)` counted URL chars)
  - Word counts
  - Accessibility text extraction
- `InlineElement::to_plain_text(&self) -> &str` - Extract text from inline elements (links return link text, images return alt text)
- `ListItem::to_plain_text(&self) -> String` - Extract text from list items including nested blocks
- `ContentBlock::to_plain_text(&self) -> String` - Extract text from any content block recursively
- `to_plain_text(markdown: &str) -> String` - Standalone function to parse and extract plain text in one call
- Exported `to_plain_text` from `turbovault_parser` crate and prelude
- **Search result metrics**: `SearchResultInfo` now includes `word_count` and `char_count` fields for content size estimation
- **Export readability metrics**: `VaultStatsRecord` now includes `total_words`, `total_readable_chars`, and `avg_words_per_note`

### Changed

- **Search engine uses plain text**: Tantivy index now indexes plain text content instead of raw markdown, improving search relevance
- **Keyword extraction uses plain text**: `find_related()` now extracts keywords from visible text only, excluding URLs and markdown syntax
- **Search previews use plain text**: Search result previews and snippets now show human-readable text without markdown formatting

## [1.2.3] - 2025-12-10

### Fixed

- Updated turbomcp dependency to 2.3.3 for compatibility with latest MCP server framework

## [1.2.2] - 2025-12-09

### Added

- Dependency version bump to turbomcp 2.3.2

### Changed

- Updated all workspace dependencies to latest compatible versions

### Fixed

- Optimized binary search in excluded ranges for improved performance
- Removed unused dependencies to reduce binary size

## [1.2.0] - 2024-12-08

### Added

- **`Anchor` LinkType variant**: Distinguishes same-document anchors (`#section`) from cross-file heading references (`file.md#section`). This is a breaking change for exhaustive match statements on `LinkType`.
- **`BlockRef` detection**: Wikilinks with block references (`[[Note#^blockid]]`) now correctly return `LinkType::BlockRef` instead of `LinkType::HeadingRef`.
- **Block-level parsing**: New `parse_blocks()` function for full markdown AST parsing, including:
  - `ContentBlock` enum: Heading, Paragraph, Code, List, Blockquote, Table, Image, HorizontalRule, Details
  - `InlineElement` enum: Text, Strong, Emphasis, Code, Link, Image, Strikethrough
  - `ListItem` struct with task checkbox support
  - `TableAlignment` enum for table column alignment
- **Shared link utilities**: New `parsers::link_utils` module with `classify_url()` and `classify_wikilink()` functions for consistent link type classification.
- **Re-exported core types from turbovault-parser**: `ContentBlock`, `InlineElement`, `LinkType`, `ListItem`, `TableAlignment`, `LineIndex`, `SourcePosition` are now directly accessible from `turbovault_parser`, eliminating the need for consumers to depend on `turbovault-core` separately.

### Changed

- **Heading anchor generation**: Now uses improved `slugify()` function that properly collapses consecutive hyphens and handles edge cases per Obsidian's behavior.
- **Consolidated duplicate code**: Removed duplicate `classify_url()` implementations from engine.rs and markdown_links.rs in favor of shared utility.

### Fixed

- **Code block awareness**: Patterns inside fenced code blocks, inline code, and HTML blocks are no longer incorrectly extracted as links/tags/embeds.
- **Image parsing in blocks**: Fixed bug where inline images inside paragraphs were causing empty blocks.
